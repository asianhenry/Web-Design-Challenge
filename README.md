# League of Legends Champion Diversity

Welcome to my web project. This project is an analysis on the champion meta diversity in the professional League of Legends scene, specifically
during the Spring 2020 split across 4 major regions of LoL.

Data was retrieved from: https://gol.gg/esports/home/

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)

Data was cleaned using Pandas and visualization created using Matplotlib. Using the data of champions played during the split, I calculated a score on
how diverse the champion meta was for each region. I also created some visualization looking at the most prevalent champions in the meta (most played/banned)
